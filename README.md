# GP Per Hour

_Track your gp/hr across various trips and save your sessions for later viewing._

GP Per Hour is a comprehensive money making tracker, that will accurately calculate your gp/hr by combining your profits and losses over time for any activity.

What makes this more accurate than any other profit tracker? 
- Tracks loss of charge components from weapons, armor, and utility items (Trident, blowpipe, crystal armor, blood essence etc.)
- Keeps track of items in containers (Looting bag, herb sack, etc.)
- Ability to assign value to untradeable items (Tokkul, crystal shards, etc.)
